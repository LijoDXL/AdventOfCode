```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```python
%matplotlib inline
```

## Part 1

```python
# given that fabric is atleast 1000x1000 inches 
fabric = np.zeros((1000,1000))
```

```python
# read only the numbers from puzzle input
df = pd.read_clipboard(header=None,sep="\s+|:|,|x",usecols=[2,3,5,6],names=['left','top','width','height'])
```

```python
df.info()
```

```python
# index the array with given dimensions
for x,y,dx,dy in df.itertuples(index=False):
    fabric[y:y+dy,x:x+dx] += 1
```

```python
# to visualize the fabric
import seaborn as sns
```

```python
# fabric after accounting for all claims
sns.heatmap(fabric,robust=True)
```

```python
# mark all chunks with overlap as 1 and rest as zero
fabric_mask = np.where(fabric>1,1,0)
```

```python
# now a simple sum would give the total square
# inches of overlap
fabric_mask.sum()
```

## Part 2

```python
# check those chunks which have no overlaps (where value is still 1)
for idx,x,y,dx,dy in df.itertuples():
    if (fabric[y:y+dy,x:x+dx] == 1).all():
        print("claim ID for non-overlap will be: ",idx+1) # +1 coz index starts at 0 while ID begins at 1
```

```python

```
